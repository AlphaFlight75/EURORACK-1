This little guide was made for beginners to provide some orientation and inspiration how to set up your workspace, 
choose the tools and methods you need in order to complete your ST Modular or any other DIY build. 
It´s not an objective manual and makes no claim to be complete. But it might help some of you to find your way into Eurorack DIY 
and saves you from making mistakes I have been through. There are many ways how to solder and complete a DIY project 
from sourcing to finally testing the freshly built module. This is how I got some good results. Have fun, Stefan

If you have any suggestions or change requests, please don´t hestitate to share them in the Facebook "ST MODULAR Builders Group".
