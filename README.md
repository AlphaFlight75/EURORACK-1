If you got spare PCBs you will need to solder 0603 packaged components. The PCBs are not necessarily designed to be builder friendly as there are very tiny components included (e.g. SOD-523 diodes). Therefore the modules are recommended to be soldered by experienced builders only. Successful construction, safe powering and necessary calibration of the module is purely your responsibility. You are solely responsible for ensuring the finished module will not damage other equipment that you connect it to. Damage to other equipment is your responsibility. I am not responsible if you injure yourself or others, or damage any of your property or others property during the construction or use of PCBs provided.

I do not offer or perform repairs of any type.
